Zebaro-Core-Bot is a multi-platform automation bot built with Python. It combines a Telegram bot, a Discord bot,
a FastAPI-based webhook service, and a background scheduler. With it you can manage Docker containers, receive
GitHub repository event notifications, scrape and filter job openings from popular sites, and deliver useful updates
right into your chats.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The project is currently under active development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zebaro24/Zebaro-Core-Bot.git
   cd Zebaro-Core-Bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies with Poetry

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Create a .env file with required variables

   ```dotenv
   # Required
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=xxxxx:yyyyy
   TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID=123456789
   TELEGRAM_DOCKER_ACCESS_IDS=123456789,987654321
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   PERSONAL_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   PERSONAL_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-webhook-secret
   WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.tld

   # Optional (have defaults)
   DEBUG=false
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/zebaro_core
   PLAYWRIGHT_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:9222
   ```

   Notes:
   - TELEGRAM_DOCKER_ACCESS_IDS is a comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs with Docker control access.
   - By default, MongoDB and the Playwright browser endpoint are expected locally; see Docker Quick Start below.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker Compose)

This project includes a docker-compose.yml to spin up MongoDB, a Playwright browser server, and the bot + webhooks service.

```bash
# Ensure you exported the required environment variables or created a .env file
docker compose up -d
```

- Services started:
  - MongoDB (zebaro-core-db)
  - Playwright server (zebaro-core-playwright)
  - Core bot + webhooks (zebaro-core-bot) on port 8000 by default

---

## üß≠ Running Locally (without Docker)

1. Start a Playwright browser server (or keep the one from Docker):

   ```bash
   npx playwright@1.55.0 run-server --port 9222
   ```

2. Ensure MongoDB is running locally (or via Docker).

3. Activate the virtual environment and run the app:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   python -m app.main
   # or
   poetry run python -m app.main
   ```

The webhooks API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000, with routes under /webhook.

---

## üß™ Testing

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Run all project tests and check functionality.
